So now she has to come back tomorrow and pay the remaining $1600 and borrow money to put gas in it.	Negotiated great price via email, very friendly and responsive salesman.	Ross was very helpful in helping us get the car we wanted and at an amazing deal.	Their prices matched the lowest quotes I received and it was an easy decision to go with Superior considering how quickly Jay would respond to my inquiries and never did I feel pressured to make a decision or to choose them.	So i said great lets do it, he kept my Mercedes 2001 ML 320 with only 145.000 miles on it, great car and hoping to get it fixed soon .	I do not like their pushy sales guys or their service department but they do an amazing job on vehicle detailing!!	We had been planning to look at other car dealerships that day, but decided to go for this one instead.	But after being a customer of Carter's, I can honestly say that David and Wendy both have my interest at heart.	Totally painless oil change for a reasonable price.	The purchasing drill was refreshingly quick and organized, which we appreciated.	Great dealership that really knows enthusiast cars.	Recently sold my Audi R8 here on consignment.	Truly, the quickest, most painless and even pleasant car buying experience of my life.	This dealership WORKS WITH YOU.	This is not a complement.	My daughter traded in this hunk of junk and got 1K for it.	I again worked with David North.	Now, 12 months after I purchased my Impreza, I'm trying to get a gap refund after paying off my loan and am getting nothing but lies and procrastination.	I thought about it for a few days and decided I wanted to buy it!	I didn't feel like I was being bamboozled.	Of those, 5 were for personal vehicles.	and just wait for 45 min for my car until it was finished.	Pressure test was $125 and then the radiator replacement was going to cost almost $1,100!	Of course there are risks involved with buying any used car and it is my fault for trusting such a character.	Excellent service and quality vehicles.	Friendly, Honest, Fair, and World-class service!!	We ended up purchasing another car over the weekend from a different company, but we wanted to thank Craig for staying an hour late to work with us on our preferences for purchasing a Chevy Sonic LTZ.	I was greeted warmly as I walked in, and was soon directed to talk to Cliff, a friendly, well-spoken sales person for Bob Byers.	Best used dealer I've ever been too.	But I didn't feel the need to text back.	We will be coming to Dan for everything from here on out.	JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!	Fin answered our many questions and put up with 3 visits over a week and a half period (and numerous calls and texts in between).	He did the work, I thought, and I got my car back only to have the clutch go out on me AGAIN in the middle of the I-90 bridge.	(All I want to do is bring my car back home the same condition as I had left it with them.)	Carter Shoreline Subaru Employee: "The update takes 45 minutes but is finicky, if someone opens a door during the update it needs to start all over, so it usually takes an hour and a half."	Note: Their services are pricey so are their cars.	Andy and his team are amazing people.	So now we have an unsafe car that we paid $6000.	We will be customers for life, thank you Zac, Brandon, and the Auto Quest team!	This is the second car we've purchased from Carter.	You decide; hopefully it works out...

As soon as my husband & I parked, we were greeted by an upbeat music coming from the mega speakers installed up the dealership's roof.	He even offered advice about some different warranty options that was really helpful - he did not pressure us into picking the higher cost one, and in fact helped us understand why that might be a bad decision anyway.	Over the next 24 hours I did a lot of research on Land Rover/Range Rover and decided I wanted to pursue this.	The finance manager even has the nerve to say that they're still within the 5-7 business days quoted to me because they didn't receive it until the January 25th (which is a lie!	Thank you for being there.	Brand new front brakes, 

Both the driver and passenger side brake pads showed good percentages on the outside.	You'll thank yourself later.	I spend a lot of my time out of the country so it doesn't make sense for me to keep an expensive STI around anymore.	My bet is it will be a better final price and better service.	My original plan was to do a visual inspection of what appeared to be a great used Volvo wagon, then come back later w/out twins and test drive.	Then a friend told us about Heidi.	The selection, service and experience is definitely a cut above when compared to Sandberg Volvo and no way a somewhat close second place to Barrier Volvo.	Atticus is a personable and knowledgeable young man who treated us kindly and understood exactly what we were looking for.	My tongue would itch & numb.	Never bought a car that had a car note attached.	The way they took care of me felt like a family member not a car salesmen.	The following day, we received an email saying WE would need to take care of those ourselves.	He was personable, talked to us like non-car people (which is what WE personally needed) and he made the car buying experience just awesome.	A dealership there had allowed us to make an appointment to see a car, but when we arrived we were informed the car wasn't there.	My experience was great.	I had to drive it to and from work for the time being babying it the hole way.	In total these two issues costed me about $700 within about 2 weeks from getting the car.	At no point during the search did I feel that he was trying to push me into something I didn't want and couldn't afford.	Cliff, the salesman, came out to greet me within a minute or two and was very friendly without being pushy at all.	My husband and both agree we would buy from the guys at Millennium Motors again.	In the meantime within a week of buying the car it had rained for the first time, and we came out and found our seats soaked as the sunroof leaked.	If anyone can get you financed TAMI can.	We got a great car (still under factory warranty) for a great price.	I drove the car 50 miles home to Tacoma, no issues.	Thanks, James, for helping us get a great deal on the car we wanted!	I found him incredibly responsive, honest, and diligent.	This guy knows his business and works very hard.	My score wasn't as bad as I thought, but I was hesitant to put any money down.	Before I even set foot on the lot after a few days of online communication I committed to purchasing the vehicle.	Great, cheap enough part, but the work will cost about $1000.	In the end, my brakes feel awesome, I take road bumps like a champ, amd my engine runs so smooth and quite its amazing.	They are the best car sale people I have ever met.	I bought a used 2011 BMW Z4 from them about two months ago.	I look forward to working with Auto Quest in the future, and will recommend them to anyone I know who is in the market for a luxury vehicle at a great price!	I have taken my little convertible bug here many times for many different issues.	Hopefully she can get out of there before her business reputation is completely ruined.	We first talked about what kind of cars I had owned in the past (basic Chevette 2 Dr, VW Camper, Peugeot 505 4DR, and  Volvo 4DR loaded) had I bought new or used, what I liked about them and didn't, how long I liked to keep my cars, what I could afford, had I prequalified  myself for a loan (yes, I used to be a real estate agent and understood the importance of being prepared) and what I wanted in a replacement.	The service department - not so much.	Bill was even kind enough to wash my car for me before I took it home.	Can't sweat it enough!	When we were ready to test drive again they let us take off on our own.	Our poor old car died and the repairs were more than the cost of the car, so, after MANY years, we were put in the position of buying a car.	They were very kind and helpful, explained the financing process, and I left with a great car.	They also have a program where you can get money or less money owed on your car by referring people to them.	However one of their cars caught my eye so I decided to check it out.	I would recommend this place.	Answered all my questions concerning the warranties remaining on the vehicle and treated me with kindness and respect.	I went for a test drive, talked things over with my son and decided to buy it as a surprise for my wife.	We next needed the car for several hours so we could get a thorough inspection done.	They were honest, easy to work with and had perfect follow through.	Carlos at EBAB was really knowledgeable and easy to work with.	A few days after purchase, car started stalling and stopping in the middle of the road.	He made our daughter feel very comfortable considering she has never had to test drive or purchase a car on her own.	These guys know what they're doing.	They were every straight forward and professional.	Time will tell who is correct, but my instinct is telling me that Carter is simply looking for ways to turn recall repairs into money making opportunities.	I loved the dogs walking around the place too!	-The general manager Scott was horrid and told us we wasted his time (when even agreeing to sit with us to discuss the fee they wouldn't budge on was wasting our time).	I have a 23 year old SAAB and thought I would have to get a new car upon moving to Seattle.	The staff was very courteous and helpful, in fact, they even found me a better rate on my loan, and called me back the day after I purchased the vehicle to update the documents and lock in my lower interest rate.	We were looking for a replacement car after our Audi A6 was totaled and had no idea in which direction we wanted to go.	They even knocked some money off the final price, due to some minor repairs it needed (windshield).	They got the work done and checked out the entire car, and handled the insurance folks as well.	Beware of Carter Subaru, I advise you to buy your vehicle elsewhere.	(WORD TO THE WISE: Don't bother looking elsewhere).	They no longer match prices.	Fin is really great to work with!	There was no pressure and they bent over backwards to find a finance option I could afford and would cover the purchase 100%.	Ive had the car about three weeks now and it is a solid car.	I came to this place after and the guy always makes his best effort to explain what is wrong with my car.	Jon the manager is really nice, informative, and so helpful.	I wasn't sure how this would go.	Thank to Rene for all his help!	If you have a good experience it's because you were simply lucky.	Strongly recommend you go elsewhere.	Stellar service, amazing cars and all sold by a person, Brian, who cares about the transaction, his cars, and making the buyer happy!	So this used car purchase was a real nerve-wrecking, I almost had an anxiety/panic attack, I wanted to faint moment.	Mudarri said, "No worries, we'll fix it".	Even made a couple visits in person.	They charge an up front $120 diagnostic fee, and told me it is not deducted from the cost of repairs if you go forward with service -- in other words, just tack $120 extra on any repair that you have done here.	I'll be coming back for sure if its to buy, sell, or just get my newer car back to pristine condition.	It's not ideal to buy online but if we do it again we will call them since it was a painless & fast deal, and luckily for the exact car we hoped to get!	Overall, there are better car dealerships that'll help you find the right Volvo for you and you should go this route because this business want your patronage.	If you want a no pressure, none nonchalant buying experience Platinum is the place!!	It hasn't had any problem so far, and there is nothing broken in the car.	Call or email Heidi - she WILL take care of you!	I highly recommend them.	This woman has connections!	I cannot explain how thankful i was for how calm they were and how helpful they were.	Usual wear and tear for a used sports car.	If you make a good amount of money, and don't know what to do with it, do yourself a favor and get yourself a treat here.	After some emails we called Bellevue Auto House and spoke with Alan.	I personally really like there team
Great dealership
Huge car selection

Walking in was hospitable from the start.	They do amazing work, are super friendly and fair.	I am in contact with thousands of people a day, you can rest assure, I will not send them their way, not even my worst enemy.	Have purchased two vehicles here.	I read every regional CL ad twice daily, in addition to checking forums, and classifieds.	He always treated me well when he managed Big O tires and now as manager of Eastside Motor Company, I have not only bought two vehicles from him, he has sold a truck for me as well.	The best part is the price they offered is very reasonable.	I absolutely would recommend them to any one looking for a reasonably priced vehicle that knows what " as-is" means.	This is SOOOO VERY unprofessional.	Moe knows Saab's inside and out, I trust his work 100%  

All of these 5 star reviews should relieve any concern you may have.	What more can I really say?	However, if you hate negotiating during the car buying experience, then it's up your alley.	When the follow-up call came from Toyota of Seattle, I told her how disappointed I was.	She brought the keys right out, got us all set up for a test drive, and was pleasant and easy to talk to.	I was told the car should be ready Saturday because they were overnighting the part.	She even took a picture of me leaping for joy next to my "new baby" which made its first trip to Portland on one tank of gas recently.	Their expertise was legit.	Carols did a terrific job helping us finalize our vehicle selection and complete the purchase with no typical "car dealer" pressure at all.	One of the best customer service experiences I've ever had!	I asked to see a manager, who did not acknowledge there was anything wrong and reiterated that the diagnostic charge was in addition to any repair they might do.	If you ask they will tell.	Once again I was directed to a few perfect choices and a great price was given to me on each.	Both new and used vehicles were discussed -- Buyer's Advantage offers both.	The hard part was over, right?	Heidi acts as a buyer's agent and it's nice to have someone on your side.	I would NOT recommend buying a vehicle from Auto Quest!	He was very nice and even took my car on his day off - on Sunday when most other car washes are closed.	For sure next time I'm in the market for a car I will head to Superior Motors first.	His sales manager, John Brennan, also provided perfect service and follow through.	The Owner at Armadillo was giving this person his price on replacing the window.	I drop off my car for a day, picked it up in the evening, the car was fully refurbished!!!	I went there based on the high quality inventory, good pricing, and excellent yelp reviews, and was not disappointed.	A fantastic place to by a car~!	I was lucky enough to get both!	I was totally brushes aside by this dealer and was dismissed for a minor problem, which actually turned out to be quite serious.	He found me a car with low miles and a great price.	I also felt that because I did NOT buy a Subaru they really didn't care to help me.	I love how it handles; much cleaner braking, steering and acceleration than my '98.	Before we bought it they assured us it had been checked out completely AND the owner had been using it as his commuter car.	I drove couple of them and ended up buying bmw 328 conv.	I can't recommend them highly enough!	They are rude, they lie, & you will drive away feeling dirty.	I test drove it, it ran good.	This is our second purchase with this company.	After my purchase, they  got the car tuned up from bmw service center to make sure everything is good.	I would recommend it to any buddy who's looking for great quality car and deals that would help you financially.	Shouldn't the service be the best when interacting with Sales because they want revenue?	So, when I returned to pick it up, I was charged a hefty $142.00 !!	We came looking for a car for our daughter and left with one for me as well.	We were given one and an IOU for the second which we were told we would receive "in a few days" in the mail.	But once we got there the vehicle had damages that he was trying to cover up.	The blue book value for this exact car, in excellent condition is 11K.	My wife and I purchased a PT Cruiser from the owner of this establishment several years ago.	Told it would be here in 3 business days.	They clearly have good connections in the area to get their hands on really nice vehicles for good prices.	I went there to buy a dodge flatbed and they where very honest and low pressure, I used to be in the car business and it was refreshing to say the least, I did not trade my 560sl in that day but would return to do business in the future

WOW is not enough to describe how great these guys.	While he may be considered a "dealer" because of the Magnolia Motors location, I found the experience to have the best part of the personal experience with the advantages offered by working with a dealer.	The bad: The car they offered to sell us for $12,000 was unfit and unsafe to drive at any speed.	Great cars for great prices.	I've been to several dealerships, Sunset Auto in Auburn, Enterprise car sales in Renton, Burien Chevrolet, Toyota of Bellevue, Auburn car sales.	They both help me get the car that I wanted and on top of that they gave me the priced that I was looking forward for my Bmw that I traded in to help me drive home that new new 2016 Mustang ford Gt that same day!!!	He helped me understand the the differences between the various models of both new and certified used cars, including their features and differing warranties.	When you walk into the store you feel like you are at a new car dealer.	You don't have to , contact Heidi and she will do everything for you!	I felt my car was somewhat overpriced and tried to haggle, and ended up walking out without the car.	WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE WAS GOING TO LEGEND AUTO SALES.	Billy did seem friendly and easy going.	I was so frustrated and wanted it over since I plan on refinancing the car in a few months anyway.	The customer service when calling in to talk to the Sales Department is pretty bad.	Genius, ethical, honest.	He had been sitting there waiting for my return to purchase the car he had already agreed to buy.	Some of the coolest cars and great staff, they will def help you find your next car!	That effort from him shows that they care and would like to know what they can do better.	To be honest, I did not purchase any car here but a couple of services for my Aston and my SAAB.	We went there looking to purchase a car we had seen online.	Financing was quick and easy and Kandis was surprisingly knowledgable about the car she was selling me.	-drive auto center customer for life.	I know this is standard in most care sales rooms, but it was extra appreciated since I looked like a soaked bird.	By far one of the greatest and easiest dealerships to do business with.	Thanks David & Wendy!	There was zero disappointment as he was very detailed and honest about the condition of the car beforehand so there were no surprises when I came in on a weekend.	These guys are LIARS; are disrespectful; clearly lack morals and ethics, and have no qualms whatsoever about breaking their word.	The one star still stands, and my car is still having problems.	Their selection is very unique so it is fun just for visiting.	They had an Audi Q5 S-line that was priced very competitively and it had the bigger motor and one of the colors we were looking for.	100% reliable and trustworthy.	We initially met with Sam, who was really friendly and helped us narrow down our search a bit.	They were quick to respond and very respectful to however I wanted to approach things.	15 minutes later of searching and not knowing where he went, we finally connect.	I have had my Mini for 5 years and have now spent more than $9,000 on unscheduled repairs (things going wrong that are not supposed to).	I set up an appointment, drove to their location and a rude man told me that the person I was to meet with was too busy to meet with me.	Still appreciate Andrea's efforts though!	They were also extremely knowledgeable in regards to the negotiation process and helped me understand what I should pay for and the seller should pay for moving forward.	They know how to do it right.	It's been four months of battle with this cancer causing Prius and I'm not liking the Dealership response to this problem.	It always worked out best and you proved it today.	Way to go Jamie and Richard!!!	The clear coat on my car was peeling.	Well... part of it was my fault because my father and I had been bickering back and forth about my next car and we were literally at each other's throat at this point so they were kind of lucky we came because they had a sale, but neither of us were fully happy.	I was excited about the service when I first researched it.	Robert also gave me a fair trade in price for my Infiniti G37 and Andrew secured a pretty low interest rate for financing, which I didn't get even from my own credit union.	Tacoma dealership never disappoints.	He uses it to run a credit report to try and qualify and convince you to finance through them so they can make more money off of you.	They use 164 well water!	They don't have any idea why I wasn't notified, apparently, and offered to FedEx them to me.	This is the 3rd vehicle that my family has purchase from this wonderful establishment.	Rezwan Malek and Chris Potter worked with me.	Overall I had a great experience with them.	Hello SSMOTORS.....A fantastic,amazing,great, Dealership to get your car from...
Serjio & Heather where great made me a deal i could not refuse and they where sooooooooo friendly and helpful would definitely send all my friends and family to SSMOTORS..:)))))))))))))))))))))) LOVE YOU GUYS

jANET

Absolutely GREAT place to do business with.	What a breath of fresh air to buy a car from Enterprise!	Matt & Joelle were awesome salespeople!	**Long Review Warning**

If you don't like reading; essentially I will tell you, do not trust the mechanic they rely on as they are incompetent in regards to inspecting vehicles.	Can't stand that stuff.	Finally I saw a Facebook post of an E39 M5 at APX Auto Brokers.	Great place to purchase vehicle.	It went bad 3 months later but he replaced it at no charge and had a car for me to drive while he was fixing it.	I will definitely be back when it's time to buy the next vehicle.	I personally would not suggest buying a vehicle from them unless they can provide you with a pre-purchase vehicle inspection report from a trusted third party mechanic.	I ended up here after getting a high quote for struts and when I called Moe's he had a much better offer.	The collection is absolutely amazing!	I barely made it to the next exit before it gave out entirely and had to have it towed back to his garage.	Zac has been in the business a long time but never gave me the impression I was bothering him with my questions and expectations.	We're a couple of old folks and have purchased a lot of cars and motorcycles over the years.	Thank you so much guys for everything.	It was cold outside so they invited me in to their toasty and cozy office.	Looks like it's family owned which made the whole experience feel a lot more intimate and comfortable.	Such as an inspiring car.	As long as you go into this place knowing that they mean it when they say they don't negotiate on prices, your experience will be great.	No pressure, no hassles, no manipulation, no lies, and no problems.	He asked who I was also looking at and when I mentioned someone he started trying to talk bad about them and that those cars are crap and that I should pick Subaru.	I was told that they would do a couple of tests and then let me know what was wrong.	Aly the General Manager is amazing and helped me with my purchase as well as anything else I had questions on.	I attempted one more time and got nothing but disrespect.	It sure felt like I was doing a private deal, not interacting with a dealer.	I don't even understand it myself.	Finally, Fin offered to go out and find me the car I was looking for since I wasn't in a hurry.	We've called so many times it's a joke.	They said it would be in in a week.	I fell in love with the car, and decided to buy.	More to come when I actually take he car in for service.	Traded in my car and got a new one from here and had an amazing experience.	He begins talking about how "spacious" the car was - it's a Spark, it's not spacious by any means, but he was clearly trying to impress me.	Vasco wasn't able to meet me in person, but he informed me via email that he had made arrangements for me to be well taken care of.	SoSo-
Description of vehicle, 85%-90% accurate.	I brought this to light and asked whether the car had been inspected for any problems.	When we got there, the salesman stated that there were some issues with the transmission.."But of course we disclosed that in the ad, we ALWAYS do that..."    NOT TRUE...

We rechecked the ads to see how we might have overlooked that notice.	From the first handshake to the last, it was all Chris, and we really liked that.	Sean is absolutely awful.	Dan took a look, drove around the block with me to test the breaks and said everything was fine and to come back in 20,000 miles for break work.	Mike, our salesman was just as sweet & a soft spoken gentle man.	We were delighted with the speed and quality of the transaction.	I just bought a Kia and I loved the experience at The Price Is Right car dealer.	He informed me that the majority of these issues are issues that have been there long over a year.	An oxygen sensor went out after an engine cleaning.	I recommend this team!	Paid $600 fee for the broker's  service; and ended up getting a very mediocre (and overpriced) purchase.]	I found Halo from Yelp due to the high rating and they truly earn the 5 star from my experience.	Matt and George talk good games but in the end they are just more used car dealers with no ethics.	Old men ignoring my female opinions, asking where my husband is and if my Dad is on hand to "get down to business" (eye roll), hard sell haggling tactics, yelling, bullying, bold faced lying - I have seen it ALL.	We just moved into the neighborhood and are looking for a great mechanic to take care of our Toyotas.	You then write a check to Heidi for her fee and a second check to the dealer for the car.	The sales associate daisy was very nice... Tammy was very manipulative and non professional.	She offered me a free oil change.	Ecery time we arrive we are treated with the utmost respect and Tim would never allow us to leave unsatisfied.	After the initial drive, we came back a day later and got an estimate for our trade.	It was a bit of an emotional purchase for me as well, so I was a bit freaked out.	I had been going to another mechanic for a couple of years.	Or we have a lender ready to go if you put another 1000 down.	I trust these guys with my car!!	I was quoted on 15 minutes to finish paperwork to get my car, but the salesman had me there for 3+ hours because he kept leaving to try and make sales.	A cute little Ford Focus.	He had all the paperwork ready when I got there to trade in my old car and finance the new car, he explained to me what I was signing and all I had to do was sign the dotted line, no extra paperwork for me, he did it all!	Never once had them not be willing to help us with any questions or concerns.	Called Complete Automotive and explained predicament and they made room for me within 1/2 hour.	I am looking forward to continue my relationship with Carter Subaru by having my Impreza serviced there.	Sometimes you just have to throw the books out the window when it comes to finding a car that is in such great condition with such low miles and is in such high demand."	As other people have said, nobody hovers over you as you're browsing.	Check this place our, there is just something different in the air over there.	I bought my car here for the price I wanted.	I'd highly recommend if looking for a good deal, with a personal touch and great customer service.	I would highly caution that whomever is considering hiring Marcee with Buyers Advantage do their research ahead of time on the car that they want and the price that is realistic.	His excuse was "I was just grabbing a coke."	His prices seemed high, he offered no discounts and didn't seem to care if we became his customers.	Bought a Saab at Paramount Motors a year ago.	Overall great experience.	I found the dealership from a posting on Craigslist and I thought it was in Texas, They are actually located in Lynnwood, Wa.	It was an audi looked great.	Unless you like to go to dealerships to play their game and spend many hours/days looking for the car you want (with maybe just a slightly better discount - which I didn't manage to get myself to be honest), I'd definitively go with Heidi, she is AMAZING!	Defiantly will use this place again!	7) Before we do the transaction, I want to do a once-over of the car.	I bought my first real car form here!	Most inconsistent business I've ever seen.	We went over what the financing and payments would be.	I would highly recommend this business and Sean in particular.	Never once did he pressure us or try to up-sell.	First point, Ed is a great customer-focused individual who put my needs first and my worries to rest.	I have referred many friends to her service and all have had a great experience.	I drop the truck off Tuesday night and don't expect a follow up until maybe Thursday afternoon.	his knowledge of his inventory and specs on the vehicles were all accurate and he showed me exactly what the market value of the car i wanted was worth and where his asking price landed with the competition.	The good news: the brakes are in *great* shape.	Then buys the warranty package for $2,000 from Liberty Bay.	I actually came back later that day.	They refuse to stand behind the cars they sell.	What about the other interested girl?!?!	Not the most polite person, but not a complete a hole either.	It got the car 2/4/15, today is 5/1/16 and my engine completely blew up on 4/29 which was my birthday by the way.	I would not recommend going here at all.	I am selling my car and I needed a thorough exterior/interior wash.	Thankfully Jeff figured out that I could do an "extended test drive" for 24 hrs and he would get me the temporary tags for the car the next day (today).	I had the rig inspected by an outside mechanic, and with only a few firm chats with Bill we were able to compromise on what needed to fix and what could wait.	They will forever be my go to shop in Seattle.	Something I especially liked: Their cars are clean and don't stink of nasty cleaners.	I never found any with the right price and fit the criteria I had.	He was there helping me until 9:30pm ish to get all the paper work done.	He proceeded to get me in the car I wanted to test drive and I walked out in under an hour with a 2014 BMW 428xi.	Before contacting Heidi (who was recommended to me by a friend), I searched for the car myself in many dealers from the WA state and couldn't find it and spend many hours with them.	But why should I fork over an extra fee to have someone else buy a car for me?"	EIGHT days later, I get an invoice: work -if performed - was done at the same shop that was NOT to do the work, and NOT at Hyundai.	I was in the market for a particular vehicle for my wife.	One week later, I get a call from the sales manager.	When it comes time for a new vehicle, they will be the first place we turn to.	I took a train up to near Lynnwood and he was nice enough to pick me up in the car, after hours at that.	Pat put me in a 2010 Dodge Ram that was well below blue book price and in excellent condition.	But I have found now with two cars the tires are delivered over inflated by 6-8 PSI.	I am a college student buying my first car and the car I bought from the broke down after 3 months.	On more than one occassion he has not charged me for diagnosing simple problems that involved computer resets, light bulb changes, or fuse replacements.	As i was financing the car for the first time, i was not getting good apr on the loan because of lack of credit but these guys tried hard and helped me get the lowest interest and maximum loan amount as compared to what others were offering me.	Don't be afraid to schedule there early...	Car maintenance is fine here, but don't ever purchase a car from this dealership.	They also have been great with minor fixes like oil changes or tire repairs which is great when the car is expensive to get fixed.	Well, lucky for you, you don't have to count us as a potential customer any longer.	I got twice the car I thought I'd get for $2,000 under my budget, all while working within my parameters on my schedule with an incredibly genuine seller.	Greg's told me the U-Joint in the drive shaft needed to be replaced, so I took to the stealership for a 2nd opinion.	For the first time in my life I am as happy with the service I received as I am with my amazing new sexy wheels.	I mean NO PRESSURE AT ALL.	Although the car was recently serviced, they also recommend a brake system fluid exchange, cooling system service, and to replace the micro filter.	The owner of the mechanic shop was more pissed then I was.	I'm forking over 20k+ for a car, why are you trying to haggle an extra $500 from me?	They do not let you browse through their lot.	Full size Luxury SUV for my growing family.	He also recommended the 10W-60 synthetic oil because I drive Lyft (8K-10K before another oil change needed).	However, I test drove 2 vehicles (very reasonably priced) and was greeted quickly and the salesman I worked with was genuinely nice (such a relief when working with car salesmen).	The parts department never called.	Will definitely return when our lease is up to get another one.	The next time I am in Bellevue I will definitely stop in just to say hi...and who knows...maybe another car.	It turns out 5 lights where out and the fuel sensor needed replace along with brakes.	He is easy going which we love, no pressure, and super knowledgeable and helpful to ensure we got the car we needed.	The replacement car I got from Curt believe it or not as of 7/29/2016 started to smoke on me.	Very accurate and the car was in good condition!	If they took 30 minutes instead of the hour plus they took, I would've been in and out with the test drive, options demo, negotiations and financing all within 90 minutes.	I test drove the truck with Melvin and decided that it was right for me.	In my case, I did indeed like the car and wanted to buy, but I was waiting on an insurance claim to complete so that I could finish the sale.	Top to bottom, best experience I've had with detailing.	If we did not like the car, I would return it and SUE THEM for deceptive business practices; breach of contract; and, ungodly amounts of wasted time, gas, and money in dealing with this complete debacle.	That's when we went and boy was I glad we had an appointment.	When he called he recommended only part of the 90k service - he didn't feel I needed to replace the spark plugs which would have doubled the cost of the service.	In addition, when I picked up my car, they suggested that sounds coming from the engine indicated that I needed a complete engine rebuild...on the order of $6-7000 worth of work.	We are past due on getting this review in - we bought the truck in May but here we are - better late than never!	Chris Kummer shows me the "get to know me" book that is in the car.	We met with Rob and he showed us what he could offer us for our trade and we showed him what we wanted for the truck.	Turns out two sensors were bad.	l recently purchased a Mercedes from this dealership and I have to say, my experience here has been the best car buying experience so far.	We have purchased at least 15 cars from dealers over the years and it was always the same BS, high pressure sales, game playing etc.	He said the brakes were good, engine solid, blah, blah.	I purchased yet another vehicle without any games or haggling being needed.	We were shown one car this way, but it did not thrill us and we did not want to just jump at the first thing we saw.	But I guess if you're logic is opposite to ours you could give the dealership a low rate for being so far away.........on 2nd thought, nah, it's not their fault lol

As stated in the beginning of this review, I'm thoroughly pleased and excited that I found this dealership.	I was recently sold a used Honda Civic from this location by a salesman name Patrick.	Looked at the car on the website, then him and I split up walking in pouring rain looking for the car on the lot.	I've been here a few times, but the last time I went in, things did not go well.	I highly recommend this car dealer ship to everyone!	I regret taking it in to the Nissan dealership at all.	I kept getting the roundabout spiel about how I should ignore the $150 fee because I was saving thousands of dollars by purchasing through them.	The salesman told us they did get a Cobalt in the day before, but it had been purchased by someone else almost immediately.	What gives the 5th star is that my transaction was a bit weird and involved purchasing then refunding and giving a personal check due to my financing through Fidelity.	They recommend services preemptively.	When we returned to the dealer, my sales man left for over an hour to work on financing.	They are absolutely the best!	On my initial visit, the assistant used car manager was nice and patient enough to offer options to resolve the problem.	Anyway, you should buy your car from these guys.	Knew the year, model and price I wanted.	We wanted to have it checked out ourselves and they didn't give us any grief about this, accommodated us without any hassle.	Even after my purchase, they followed up to make sure everything was ok.	My daughter has a memory now that she will carry with her the rest of her life.	Unfortunately whoever processed the shipment didn't put enough postage on it, so USPS required me ro make the trip to their office and drop a couple bucks out of pocket to receive it.	In regards to car dealerships, this one is great!	Because of my experience, I came back and looked at another car.	The said part was the stock air box filter and MAF SENSOR.	I paid for the light bulbs.	They will go out of their way to make the process a easy and convenient as possible.	I don't even give them one star.	The only solution they offered was replacement, which was very expensive.	and it's still on their website...	Tyler told us about a truck that was coming in that we should check out.	I also asked if I could take the car to a mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection and he readily agreed.	If you're looking for top-notch customer service, Liberty Bay Auto is the place to go to.	I bought my Saab 9-5 from here and have been loving it ever since.	A used car dealership that offers services like a new car dealership.	The 335d's are not common in the U.S and I ended up locating one at Auto Quest which was  competitively  priced compared to other dealers.	I was really not looking forward to having to haggle and deal with all the stereotypical car salesman stuff- this is NOT one of those places.	Stress free no hassles!	So i had a diagnostic done some place else and it cost me 300.00 so i told him what the report said and asked how much it would be to fix it, so he quoted me around 1200.00.	U didnt' fix my car and im out of 1700.00 and im a single mom taking care of a child and my sick parents ....	My husband fully researched the brand before looking at it and Fin knew more than he did.	I had heard that Liberty Bay was a good place to go and so I dropped it off for them to look at.	That's what really sold me!	If you know what's good for you avoid this place!	It would be one thing if we drove out there, and found the truck a bit overpriced and couldn't agree to a price.	No harm, no foul, but I walked away with a sour feeling.	He was understanding and didnt pressure me into purchasing something I was unsure about.	I will definitely be back when ready to buy something new!	Seemed very knowledgable about the vehicle itself and was happy to answer any questions that I had.	The free loaner is great too!	I called (extremely early in the morning) and the Dad who owns the business called and texted me.	Very good experience, took care of detailing and preparing vehicle for resale.	If you are looking at an Amazon equivalent to buying cars look no further just call Heidi .. She is fast , efficient and get's the best deal in town ...	It was also a very boring 10 years of driving.	Made us believe that our trade in wasn't worth much, but now I see it listed on the site for 3 TIMES the amount they gave us!	They made the entire experience awesome, unlike other dealerships out there.	I also had some "seeping" in my steering fluid and also sealant leak.	He knows his cars and trades good ones - his past experience working at Mini dealership makes him a trustworthy guy to buy a used Cooper from.	The sales department is about as helpful, knowledgeable and straighforward as I've ever seen at a car dealership.	See the attached photo of the report.	Heidi changes the game when it comes to buying a new car.	I took the car back and after threating to call the lender to end the loan Curt found another car which by the way didn't not want to pay for the car radiator.	He made the experience extremely easy and was flexible and reasonable.	First they sent the car to a "handy guy" that the owner knew.	Most highly recommended.	I have never purchased a vehicle so easily.	Championship motors is not a trustworthy place of business - they seem to get cosmetically nice-looking wholesale bargains (for a reason, they are trouble waiting to happen) and then they schlep them off as mechanically sound.	There really wasn't any need to haggle with price since it was priced appropriately and when we showed them the blue book quote my husband had we got the price lowered a bit.	Professionalism at is best.	She also assisted me with all the paperwork and didn't have to worry about anything at all.	Longer story short, I call to discuss this with Subaru since this was literally 12 hours after I drove it off the lot, parked it for the night and woke up to go to work.	I told him I really wanted tinted windows and he made this process easy too!	Fin gave it to me at a fantastic price, and almost the best part of the whole experience was finally meeting him in person and signing the paperwork in his office with two shiba inus at my feet :) 

If you are anything like I was when I first called Fin, you might be feeling afraid of going to a car dealership, and are wishing that buying a car could be made simple and painless by a kind, honest person.	I'll update this review as the situation develops.	And refreshingly,  we had such a pleasant experience with Paramount I wanted to note why we recommend them.	Lets begin with the car I originally wanted.	To be honest, I fully expected to pass on the car when we pulled in the lot.	I test drove 3 minivans before deciding on the Town and Country and they gave me a fair trade in value on my old car.	I definitely recommend them for car shopping.	One thing I would change though is their sales games, come on guys.	She made the entire experience so uncomfortable that we both left feeling terrible.	Thanks guys for the extreme customer service.	Serj's hole personality came into light playing phone tag and hearing enough of his BS.	They clearly have an eye for detail and went that extra mile to make our beloved Eurovan even better than before.	I also noticed that everyone that works there looks really happy.	Was a pleasure to do business with.	He called me and was very honest and clear about what he recommended.	After a follow up call to discuss further, he reneged on that offer.	We had a great experience with the salesman and we got a great price on our new car.	It is a sad realization and a late post but this concludes my rating.	I'll make sure to TELL EVERYONE I know in the military community to stay far from Carter Subaru Shoreline.	I will definitely go to them again in the future.	We placed a custom order and he was in constant communication with us about the status.	They were honest about the vehicle and helped us out right away after we took it for a spin.	In any case, I am actually grateful you did not move from your price.	They never connect me with anyone who can help and always say they will give a message to some person but we never get a call back

2) the fan for AC/heat is nearly broken and makes a super loud noise.	No more West Seattle for me.	My next visit was for an oil change and inspection.	Plenty of room for my dogs in the 5' bed and for family in the crew cab, which I love!
